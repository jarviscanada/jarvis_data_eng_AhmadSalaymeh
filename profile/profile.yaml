# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I'm a recent graduate from Wilfrid Laurier University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, looking to advance my career in data engineering. During my undergrad, I learned programming fundamentals through data structures, algorithm and database courses and obtained programming skills in languages such as Python and Java. Towards the end of my undergrad, I took courses in data engineering, such as data visualization. In which, I learned how to use Panda and numpy to process and handle data. Currently, I am working at Jarvis where I am improving my knowledge and skills in data engineering by implementing python data applications.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description:  Implemented a monitoring agent to allow the Linux Cluster Administration team to view, monitor, and obtain data on each node running in real-time. This program used bash scripts to get the information on the nodes and used crontab to obtain the current usage. These scripts can be used on different machines simultaneously. In addition, I have used docker to create a Postgresql database  with the appropriate tables to store the information.
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "JDBC App: This was a simple application to demonstrate the Postgres JDBC driver's functionality when connecting to the stores data. It involved retrieving customer and order information using Data Access Object within Java from a generated PostgreSQL database and ensuring atomicity with each transaction."
      - "Grep App: This project is a Java implementation of the grep terminal command. It recursively examines all files in a directory for lines that match a user-supplied regular expression, then saves all of those lines to a file. The project contatied two verisons, one using pre-java 8 using collections and File IO APIs, and another using Java 8 capabilities including Java Paths, Streams, and Lambdas. The Java-8 version highlighted those features to work with JVM's heap size limits"
      - "Twitter App: The Twitter Application leverages the Twitter REST API to perform CRUD operations via the command line on a user's Twitter account. Users can POST, READ, and DELETE tweets from the command line. This Java program uses HTTP Client to connect to the Twitter REST API. Maven is used to structure and install the application's dependencies. Spring boot is used to establish dependency injection with the help of the IoC container. Deployed on Docker Hub for simple distribution"
