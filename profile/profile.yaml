summary: I'm a recent graduate from Wilfrid Laurier University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, looking to advance my career in software development. During my undergrad, I learned the fundamental of programming through data structures and algorithm courses and obtained programming skills in languages such as Python and Java. Currently, I am working at Jarvis, where I am improving my knowledge and skills in programming. I enjoy tackling new challenges and pushing myself to learn more, which helps me grow. I also like to read books (Sci-Fi, Fiction Novels, Self-help) during my free time, which help me gain new perspectives. I also enjoy working out, creating music, and painting, as These activities allow me to destress and relax.

    description: I Implemented a monitor agent to allow the Linux Cluster administration to view, monitor, and obtain data on nodes/servers running in real-time. This program used bash scripts to get the information on nodes/servers and used crontab to obtain the current usage of each node/server, which can be used on different machines simultaneously. In addition, I have created a database with the appropriate tables to store the informationÂ—used docker to provision a Postgresql instance that stored the database.
