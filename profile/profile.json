This program used bash scripts to get the information on the nodes and used crontab to obtain the current usage. These scripts can be used on different machines simultaneously. In addition, I have used docker to create a Postgresql database  with the appropriate tables to store the information.",

It involved retrieving customer and order information using Data Access Object within Java from a generated PostgreSQL database and ensuring atomicity with each transaction.",
        "Grep App: This project is a Java implementation of the grep terminal command. It recursively examines all files in a directory for lines that match a user-supplied regular expression, then saves all of those lines to a file. The project contatied two verisons, one using pre-java 8 using collections and File IO APIs, and another using Java 8 capabilities including Java Paths, Streams, and Lambdas. The Java-8 version highlighted those features to work with JVM's heap size limits",

Users can POST, READ, and DELETE tweets from the command line. This Java program uses HTTP Client to connect to the Twitter REST API. Maven and spring-boot are used to structure and install the dependences for the application. Deployed on DockerHub for simple distribution"
