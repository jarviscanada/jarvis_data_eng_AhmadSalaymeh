This program used bash scripts to get the information on of the node and used crontab to obtain the current usage. These scripts can be used on different machines simultaneously. In addition, I have created a database with the appropriate tables to store the information. Used docker to provision a Postgresql instance that stored the database.",

  "summary": "I'm a recent graduate from Wilfrid Laurier University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, looking to advance my career in software development. During my undergrad, I learned the fundamental of programming through data structures and algorithm courses and obtained programming skills in languages such as Python and Java. Currently, I am working at Jarvis, where I am improving my knowledge and skills in programming. I enjoy tackling new challenges and pushing myself to learn more, which helps me grow. I also like to read books (Sci-Fi, Fiction Novels, Self-help) during my free time, which help me gain new perspectives. I also enjoy working out, creating music, and painting, as These activities allow me to destress and relax."
