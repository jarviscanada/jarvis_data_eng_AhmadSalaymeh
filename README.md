# Ahmad Salaymeh . Jarvis Consulting

I'm a recent graduate from Wilfrid Laurier University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, looking to advance my career in software development. During my undergrad, I learned the fundamentals of programming through data structures and algorithm courses and obtained programming skills in languages such as Python and Java. Currently, I am working at Jarvis, where I am improving my knowledge and skills in programming and participating in an agile environment. I enjoy tackling new challenges and pushing myself to learn more, which helps me grow.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadSalaymeh](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadSalaymeh)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadSalaymeh/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a monitoring agent to allow the Linux Cluster Administration team to view, monitor, and obtain data on each node running in real-time. This program used bash scripts to get the information on the nodes and used crontab to obtain the current usage. These scripts can be used on different machines simultaneously. In addition, I have used docker to create a Postgresql database  with the appropriate tables to store the information.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadSalaymeh/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - JDBC App: This was a simple application to demonstrate the Postgres JDBC driver's functionality when connecting to the stores data. It involved retrieving customer and order information using Data Access Object within Java from a generated PostgreSQL database and ensuring atomicity with each transaction.
  - Grep App: This project is a Java implementation of the grep terminal command. It recursively examines all files in a directory for lines that match a user-supplied regular expression, then saves all of those lines to a file. The project contatied two verisons, one using pre-java 8 using collections and File IO APIs, and another using Java 8 capabilities including Java Paths, Streams, and Lambdas. The Java-8 version highlighted those features to work with JVM's heap size limits

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadSalaymeh/tree/master/springboot)]: Not Started

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadSalaymeh/tree/master/python_data_anlytics)]: Not Started

**Hadoop** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadSalaymeh/tree/master/hadoop)]: Not Started

**Spark** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadSalaymeh/tree/master/spark)]: Not Started

## Highlighted Projects
**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadSalaymeh/tree/main/linux_sql)]: This program allows the Linux cluster Administration team to view, monitor, and obtain data on nodes/servers running. In addition, this program provides real-time resource usage, and the LCA team will use data to create reports.

**Promodo Timer**: A simple timer that follows the Pomodoro technique. Users can set their custom time for work and break. This application was developed using Javascript, HTML/CSS, and bootstrap.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2022-present)**: Implementing applications using the agile methodology Led, organized and participated in daily scrum meetings with the development team. It allowed us to communicate, problem-solve, and discuss our current goals for the day. I also practiced in scrum retro meetings, where we discussed the previous sprint cycle and how to improve moving forward. As well as used Notion to track my daily tickets and sprint backlog.
