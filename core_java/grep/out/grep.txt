    and there's Madam Juliet.                             Exeunt
    I got possession of Julietta's bed.
    With character too gross, is writ on Juliet.
  ISABELLA. Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
    What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
  ISABELLA. My brother did love Juliet,  
  Romeo, son to Montague.
  Mercutio, kinsman to the Prince and friend to Romeo.
  Benvolio, nephew to Montague, and friend to Romeo
  Balthasar, servant to Romeo.
  Peter, servant to Juliet's nurse.

  Nurse to Juliet.
  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
                       Enter Romeo.
  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
                   Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
                         Enter Juliet.
    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
    Juliet, the County stays.
Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers; Torchbearers.
  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
              Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
  Cap. Young Romeo is it?
  Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
                              Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].
  Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
                                     One calls within, 'Juliet.'
    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
    Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
Enter Romeo alone.
  Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
    Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
Enter Romeo.
                     Enter Juliet above at a window.
    It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.  
    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
                       Enter Juliet above.
  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
                     Enter Juliet again, [above].
  Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice  
    With repetition of my Romeo's name.
    Romeo!
  Jul. Romeo!
                        Enter Romeo.
    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
  Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
  Ben. Romeo will answer it.
  Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
                               Enter Romeo.
  Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!
    but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
    thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by
    Romeo?
  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you have
    Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.
    in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with
  Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!
Enter Juliet.
    choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than
  Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.
                     Enter Juliet.  
  Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
  Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
  Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
                        Enter Romeo.
  Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
         Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies
    Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,  
  Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
                                                     Exit Romeo.
    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
  Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
  Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
    Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
Enter Juliet alone.
    That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;  
    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
    That Romeo bid thee fetch?
  Nurse. Romeo can,
    Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?  
    Shame come to Romeo!  
    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
    Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
  Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
  Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
                         Enter Romeo.
    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
    But Romeo may not. More validity,  
    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    But Romeo may not- he is banished.
    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
    I come from Lady Juliet.
    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
    What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
    Romeo is coming.
    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;
Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.
    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
    Ere I again behold my Romeo!
  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?
  Lady. That same villain Romeo.
    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
    Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
                    Enter Juliet.
    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
                        Enter Juliet.
                                        Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.
    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
Juliet's chamber.
Enter Juliet and Nurse.
    Because he married me before to Romeo?
    I wake before the time that Romeo
    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
    Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
Juliet's chamber.
  Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
  Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
Enter Romeo.
                Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.
    How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,
    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
    Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
    Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
       Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
                                           Romeo opens the tomb.
    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]
    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet
    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
    Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,
  Bal. Romeo.
  Friar. Romeo!
    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
                                                   Juliet rises.
    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.
                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].
    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
     Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].
  2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.
  Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'
    Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,

    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?
  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
    As that of true and faithful Juliet.
  Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
